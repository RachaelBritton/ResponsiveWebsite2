     For as long as I can remember I have been artistic and creative.
  I was fascinated by animals and loved to play pretend and I think these aspects of my personality led me to art.
Who knew recreating things I had seen to show to others was so much fun?
  I only really pursued art because I seemed to have a knack for it though. It didn't take long for my parents to recognize my aptitude for it,
  and watching their smiles was all the encouragement I needed.
They helped encourage me and fostered my creativity alongside my teachers (who would frequently admire my doodles in class, I just couldn't stop!).

I didn't take many art classes until high school though and even then I never really considered it anything other than a hobby.
I wanted to find a way to work for Disney orPixar but because I never took art classes I was afraid I wouldn't get in. I didn't like the stigma
behind art as a professional career either. The classic "starving artist" situation terrified me, so I redirected my attention to psychology, and in the Fall of 2015 I was welcomed to the University of Miami.

<br>
While at UM I found ways to incorporate a side of art I had always been interested in but never had the opportunity
to try. Digital artwork! While I enjoyed my psychology classes I found that I couldn't deny my true calling anymore. I have to create things, but it's not for me. It's for other people.
I worked hard at UM and graduated a year early with a degree in psychology. Within the next year I will be applying to art schools across Florida to now pursue my passion of creating digital art and simulating reality for others.
